# EV Sales Trends Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Trends analysis project is to evaluate quarterly EV sales performance over recent years to understand market growth, customer adoption patterns, and changes in demand. To maintain a focused and measurable scope, the analysis concentrates on sales volume by manufacturer and does not incorporate external factors such as demographics, affordability, or gasoline prices.

This analysis helps stakeholders assess overall market momentum and identify high-growth EV manufacturers through year-over-year and quarterly trend comparisons. Primary stakeholders include EV manufacturers and their supply chain partners, who can use these insights for production planning, inventory management, and resource allocation. Secondary stakeholders include battery and charging infrastructure providers, government agencies focused on sustainability initiatives, and consumers researching market trends.

Insights from this project support data-driven decisions such as adjusting production levels, reallocating marketing efforts, entering new markets, and prioritizing technological improvements based on competitive performance.
